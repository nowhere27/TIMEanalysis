Given the virtual slide images of CD3 and CD8 immunohistochemical stains, this protocol provides the following quantitative measures of tumor immune microenvironment:

- Density of intraepithelial/stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL)
- Proportion of stroma within an annotated tumor area
- Ratio of intraepithelial and stromal TIL 
- Ratio of CD8 and CD3 TIL 

Once you annotate the tumor area manually, it segments the area into 1000 x 1000-pixel tiles. This enables you to assess not only the overall density of TIL and stroma, but also their mean, minimum, median, maximum and variance over the tiles.
